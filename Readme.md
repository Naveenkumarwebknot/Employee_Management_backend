# Spring Boot CRUD Application with Sorting, Pagination, and Caching

This Spring Boot application provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employees, timesheets, and users. It includes features such as sorting, pagination, caching with Redis, API documentation using Swagger UI, and uses PostgreSQL as the database.

## Features

- CRUD operations for Employee, Timesheet, and User entities
- Sorting and pagination for data retrieval
- Caching of data using Redis
- API documentation with Swagger UI
- Integration with PostgreSQL database

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Apache Maven
- Redis Server
- PostgreSQL Server

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crud/repository.git
   ```

2. **Configure PostgreSQL:**
    - Create a PostgreSQL database named `crud_db`.
    - Update the database configurations in `application.properties` file.

3. **Start Redis Server:**
   Start the Redis server on the default port.

4. **Build and Run:**
   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   mvn clean install
   java -jar target/your-application.jar
   ```

5. **Access Swagger UI:**
   Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` to access the Swagger UI for API documentation.

## Usage

- Use the Swagger UI to test and interact with the RESTful APIs.
- Perform CRUD operations on the Employee, Timesheet, and User entities.
- Use sorting and pagination parameters in API requests to retrieve data accordingly.
